# Formulated Problem
What makes an Airbnb listing worth it?
## Secondary problems:
What features apart from price and reviews make an apartment "worth it"?  
How can we quantify "worth" in an accurate manner?  
Can we determine if a listing is "worth it" without looking at price?  
Does the presence of certain amenities correlate with review scores?
